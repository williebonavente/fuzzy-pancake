# Midterm Quiz 1 – Database Administration (Score: 24/30)
`Scoring 24 out of 30 in this quiz is a respectable outcome, but it’s clear there’s room for improvement. Some questions were unnecessarily confusing, with wording that seemed more like a puzzle than a test of knowledge. This kind of ambiguity does not measure comprehension — it only tests patience. Critical concepts deserve clear, concise questions, not vague riddles. Moving forward, I aim to reinforce my understanding of database administration principles to ensure I can tackle even the most poorly phrased questions with confidence.`
